# Unstructured-Data-Classification
Machine Learning assignment done during first semester of M.Tech. The obective of the assignemnt is given below. All the steps used in the assignment is given in the `Unstructured_Data_Classification.ipynb` note book file.
<h2><center> Assignemt Objective</center></h2>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
These 30 scientific articles come from three different domains:<br>
PLoS Computational Biology (PLOS)<br>
The machine learning repository on arXiv (ARXIV)<br>
The psychology journal Judgment and Decision Making (JDM)<br>
There are 10 articles from each domain. In addition to the labeled data, this corpus also contains a corresponding set of unlabeled articles. These unlabeled articles also come from PLOS, ARXIV, and JDM. There are 300 unlabeled articles from each domain (again, only the sentences from the abstract and introduction).<br>
Our objective is to label each sentence in the unlabelled data set with AIMX, OWNX, CONT, BASE, MISC.<br>
Here the training set is smaller than the test set.<br>
